Graph to show centiles because the girls would understand it. 
Need to figure out a way for the girls to enter a centile and then graph it. Designing the actual

Seperate section for the scans. Contains the dates that they had the scan. Also need to be able
to add notes to each. Do not need to include the actual results of the scan, just the date which they
occured on.
Height displayed in feet and inches.
Families more likely to understand centiles than standard deviation so focus on centiles.

Need to work on database and get actual information about each drug etc.
